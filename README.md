## ü™ß Tips

The default action keyword is `cbp`, you can change it in the FlowLauncher.

Click `Copy` or directly the `search result` to copy the current data to clipboard, click `Delete` to delete the record.

If you want to save images in your clipboard, open the `CacheImages` option in settings.

This will automatically save the images to the cache folder, and you can view them in the folder `Plugin Dictionary/CachedImages`.

If you want to keep the text, images or files in the database, open the `KeepText`, `KeepImage` or `KeepFile` option in settings.

This will save the data to the database, and you won't lose them when you exit the Flow Launcher.

> Note: It is recommended to cache images using `CacheImages` option, 
saving large images via `KeepImage` to database may block query for a little while.
